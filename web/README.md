## Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][1] 2.0 or above installed.

## ES6/7 vs ClojureScript

For implementation of the client-side this project includes support for
ClojureScript, but all the functionality is currently written in ES6/7.

The compatibility wrappers of libraries such as [D3](http://d3js.org/) and
[Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) for ClojureScript that we found appear to be
out-of-date, and as we initially have only 2 days to write code for the
SpaceApps challenge we have focused on functionality instead of getting these
compatibility layers working. In future the ES6/7 might be ported to
ClojureScript.

## Running

To start a web server for the application, run:

    lein ring server

To automatically compile [ES6/7](https://babeljs.io/) changes to JavaScript, run:

    lein auto babel
    
To automatically compile [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) changes to CSS, run:

    lein auto compile

And Figwheel will automatically push and reload CSS changes to the client. It
will also compile and push [ClojureScript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript)
code changes to the client if there is ClojureScript to push, run: 

    lein figwheel
